# MainTrack

MainTrack is an application designed to streamline the aircraft maintenance process by replacing the current pen-and-paper method for defect recording with an iOS version. In the future, the concept could be expanded upon for other roles (analysts, managers, pilots) handling the information gathered by the initial maintenance employee role this prototype will address.
